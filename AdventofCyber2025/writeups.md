# Day 1
- The AoC starts off with introduction to the Linux CLI
- It included investigating a server breach by exploring files, checking logs for failed logins, and uncovering malicious scripts
- We used `cd` `ls` `grep` `sudo` `cat` `find` also piping and shell scripts

## Flags:

# Day 2:
- The second day was an introduction to phishing
- We set up a fake login page using a Python script to harvest credentials and used the Social Engineer Toolkit (SET) to send a spoofed phishing email. This tricked the target user into visiting our malicious site, where we captured their username and password.
