# The Flash - OSINT

## Solution:

- This challenge had a very high exposure image of a location
  - It had yellow black turn sign boards and seemed to be somewhat of a hilly area
  - There was also an electrical pole by the side of the road
- This lead me to believe that the location may be from India from one of the hill stations
   - There wasn't any traffic on the road
   - I checked that eucalyptus trees grow in the background
- Eucalyptus trees in hilly areas could probably be from Nilgiri hills, Kodaikanal Hills and Horsley Hills
- I started looking on google street view in the above areas and found the place in Ooty near a golf course
