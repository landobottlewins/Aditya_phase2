# GDB baby step 1
> Can you figure out what is in the eax register at the end of the main function? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}.
Disassemble this.

## Solution:

- The first thing, I ran `exiftool debugger0_a` to read the metadata of the file which gave the output 
```
ExifTool Version Number         : 12.40
File Name                       : debugger0_a
Directory                       : .
File Size                       : 16 KiB
File Modification Date/Time     : 2025:10:22 19:07:31+05:30
File Access Date/Time           : 2025:10:22 19:08:59+05:30
File Inode Change Date/Time     : 2025:10:22 19:08:13+05:30
File Permissions                : -rw-r--r--
File Type                       : ELF shared library
File Type Extension             : so
MIME Type                       : application/octet-stream
CPU Architecture                : 64 bit
CPU Byte Order                  : Little endian
Object File Type                : Shared object file
CPU Type                        : AMD x86-64

```

- Here the file is a `.so` which can be "disassembled" using `gdb` as mentioned in the hint 
- Next, I ran the `gdb ./debugger0_a` command to open the file in gdb followed by `disassemble main` to disassemble the main function   
```
Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x0000000000001129 <+0>:     endbr64
   0x000000000000112d <+4>:     push   %rbp
   0x000000000000112e <+5>:     mov    %rsp,%rbp
   0x0000000000001131 <+8>:     mov    %edi,-0x4(%rbp)
   0x0000000000001134 <+11>:    mov    %rsi,-0x10(%rbp)
   0x0000000000001138 <+15>:    mov    $0x86342,%eax
   0x000000000000113d <+20>:    pop    %rbp
   0x000000000000113e <+21>:    ret
End of assembler dump.
(gdb)
```

- Now we can read the hex value associated with `eax` which is `0x86342`
- Converting hex to decimal we get `549698` which gives the flag `picoCTF{549698}`

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{549698}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- What is gdb and how we can use it to disassemble a file
- gdb is a debugging program to examine problems for C and C++
- disassembler translates machine language into assembly language
- `gdb ./debugger0_a` and `disassemble main` are the basic commands

# ARMssembly 1
For what argument does this program print `win` with variables 83, 0 and 3? File: chall_1.S Flag format: picoCTF{XXXXXXXX} -> (hex, lowercase, no 0x, and 32 bits. ex. 5614267 would be picoCTF{0055aabb})

## Solution:
- The challenge uses a file with `.S` extension which stores the source code of a program in assembly
- We can analyse the code to understand what it does
- the required "win" condtion is mentioned in .LC0 which means it must be mentioned somewhere in the code where it is called


reading the `func`
```
	mov	w0, 83
	str	w0, [sp, 16]
	str	wzr, [sp, 20]
	mov	w0, 3
	str	w0, [sp, 24]
```
gives values and memory location 
- 83 is at sp 16
- 0 is at sp 20
- 3 is at sp 24



```
	ldr	w0, [sp, 20]
	ldr	w1, [sp, 16]
	lsl	w0, w1, w0
	str	w0, [sp, 28]
```
- w0 = 0
- w1 = 833

`lsl` is logical shift left
- w0 = w1 << w0
- 83 << 0 = 83
now it stores 83 at sp 28 



```
	ldr	w1, [sp, 28]
	ldr	w0, [sp, 24]
	sdiv	w0, w1, w0
	str	w0, [sp, 28]
```
- w0 at sp 24
- sdiv will perform integer division
- 83/3 = 27 and stored in sp 28 now




```	
    ldr	w1, [sp, 28]
	ldr	w0, [sp, 12]
	sub	w0, w1, w0
	str	w0, [sp, 28]
```
- w1 = 27
- w0 is set to a new memory location sp 12 which means a new variable (assume a)
- w0 = 27 - a 
- and now 27 - a is stored in sp 28




```
	ldr	w0, [sp, 28]
	add	sp, sp, 32
	ret
```
- w0 = 27 - a




Now, we look for where LC0 is called to get the win condition. It is mentioned towards the end of the `main`
```
adrp	x0, .LC0
	add	x0, x0, :lo12:.LC0
	bl	puts
	b	.L6
``` 
it indicates that the function must return 0 to get the win condition 

- hence 27 - a = 0 and a is 27.
- So the argument to be passed with the program must be 27 to print win.
- hex(27) = 0x1b


thus the required flag is picoCTF{0000001b}





## Flag:

```
picoCTF{0000001b}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- A `.S` file is a source code file written in assembly language
- Basics of comprehending assembly code for arm64
- Assembly code for different architechtures is slightly different

## Notes:
- I tried to run the program through arm emulation on x64 on qemu and gcc (idk i couldnt figure out exactly)

# Vault door 3
> This vault uses for-loops and byte arrays. The source code for this vault is here: VaultDoor3.java


## Solution:
Looking at the java code we can understand the following


```
import java.util.*;

class VaultDoor3 {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        VaultDoor3 vaultDoor = new VaultDoor3();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter vault password: ");
        String userInput = scanner.next();
	String input = userInput.substring("picoCTF{".length(),userInput.length()-1);
	if (vaultDoor.checkPassword(input)) {
	    System.out.println("Access granted.");
	} else {
	    System.out.println("Access denied!");
        }
    }
```
- This part is mainly for asking the user to input password
- It also verifies the password based on the "checkPassword" function and gives output


```
 public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
        if (password.length() != 32) {
            return false;
        }
        char[] buffer = new char[32];
        int i;
        for (i=0; i<8; i++) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
        }
        for (; i<16; i++) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(23-i);
        }
        for (; i<32; i+=2) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(46-i);
        }
        for (i=31; i>=17; i-=2) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
        }
        String s = new String(buffer);
        return s.equals("jU5t_a_sna_3lpm18g947_u_4_m9r54f");
    }
}
```
this is the interesting part since it manipulates the password input by user and verifies it with the string "jU5t_a_sna_3lpm18g947_u_4_m9r54f"


taking a look at it pieces
```
char[] buffer = new char[32];
int i;
```
creates a "buffer" which is just a character array


```
for (i=0; i<8; i++) {
    buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
}
```
Takes the first 8 characters and puts them into the same positions in buffer


```
for (; i<16; i++) {
    buffer[i] = password.charAt(23-i);
}
```
reverses the order of characters 8â€“15.



```
for (; i<32; i+=2) {
    buffer[i] = password.charAt(46 - i);
}
```
- index 16 on buffer will be index 30 from password 
- 18 on buffer from 28 on password
- 20 on buffer from 26 on password 
- ..and so on 



```
for (i=31; i>=17; i-=2) {
    buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
}
```
index 17 to 31 (odd numbers) is copied into buffer from password at same position


'''
String s = new String(buffer);
return s.equals("jU5t_a_sna_3lpm18g947_u_4_m9r54f");
'''
- Joins the rearranged characters into a string s.
- Compares it to the target string.


- Since this rearrangement logic is reversible, we can simply put the scrambled password as the input to get the correct password.
- But here we wouldnt get to see the correct password. We need to edit the java code to print the buffer in the end of the function.

so the last few lines would now look like:
```
System.out.println(buffer);
        String s = new String(buffer);
        return s.equals("jU5t_a_sna_3lpm18g947_u_4_m9r54f");
```

upon running the program we see
```
Enter vault password: picoCTF{jU5t_a_sna_3lpm18g947_u_4_m9r54f}
jU5t_a_s1mpl3_an4gr4m_4_u_79958f
Access denied!
```

now verifying it with the correct password:
```
Enter vault password: picoCTF{jU5t_a_s1mpl3_an4gr4m_4_u_79958f}
jU5t_a_sna_3lpm18g947_u_4_m9r54f
Access granted.
```



## Flag:

```
picoCTF{jU5t_a_s1mpl3_an4gr4m_4_u_79958f}
```

## Concepts learnt:
- Skimmed over java basics


## Notes:
- I would have manually rearranged/unscrambled the target string or created a script for the same and that's when it clicked me that I just had to edit the java code to print it for me since its basically the same thing as the script I would write.
