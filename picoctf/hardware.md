# I like Logic

> i like logic and i like files, apparently, they have something in common, what should my next step be.
challenge.sal

## Solution:

- The .sal extension and the the description reveals that the file is associated with "Saleae's Logic 2".
- So I installed the app and opened the file to find some signal
- Only channel 3 has the signal
- I looked up what the sal utilities did and analyzed it

- Then it shows a text output which gives away the flag

## Flag:

```
FCSC{b1dee4eeadf6c4e60aeb142b0b486344e64b12b40d1046de95c89ba5e23a9925}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- Data can be encoded in signals and interpreted using some specialized apps

## Notes:

- at first it seemed to be a zip file renamed for confusion
- then i found binary files but they didnt make any sense
- I looked up what the .sal was and then found the software
